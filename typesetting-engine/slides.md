# The Frog King

In olden times when wish·ing still helped one, there lived a king whose daugh·ters were all beau·ti·ful; and the young·est was so beau·ti·ful that the sun it·self, which has seen so much, was aston·ished when·ever it shone in her face. Close by the king's castle lay a great dark for·est, and un·der an old lime-tree in the for·est was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's child went out into the for·est and sat down by the side of the cool foun·tain; and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it; and this ball was her favor·ite play·thing.
