This directory contains functions which simulate common Markov processes (Poission Process, Brownian Motion, Geometric Brownian Motion, Discrete Time Markov Chains, and Continuous Time Markov Chains).

For practitioners who work with stochastic processes, it is useful to understand how such processes are generated from more basic random variables. This implementation also demonstrates how the need for random generators can be abstracted away from the end user.
