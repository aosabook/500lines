## A Brilliant Idea (That Wasn’t All That Brilliant)

When I was traveling in China I often saw series of four paintings showing the same
place in different seasons. Color&mdash;the cool whites of winter, pale hues of
spring, lush greens of summer, and reds and yellows of fall&mdash;is what
visually 
differentiates the seasons. Around 2011, I had what I thought was a brilliant
idea: I wanted to be able to visualize a photo series as a series of colors. I
thought it would show travel, and progression through the seasons.

But I didn’t know how to calculate the dominant color from an image. I thought
about scaling the image down to a 1x1 square and seeing what was left, but that
seemed like cheating. I knew how I wanted to display the images, though: in a layout
called the [Sunflower
layout](http://www.catehuston.com/applets/Sunflower/index.html). It’s the most
efficient way to lay out circles.

I left this project for years, distracted by work, life, travel, talks.
Eventually I returned to it, figured out how to calculate the dominant
color, and finally [finished my
visualization](http://www.catehuston.com/blog/2013/09/02/visualising-a-photo-series/).
And that is when I discovered that this idea wasn’t, in fact, brilliant.
The progression wasn’t as clear as I hoped, the dominant color
extracted wasn’t generally the most appealing shade, the creation took a long
time (a couple of seconds per image), and it took hundreds of images to make
something cool (\aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.sunflower}).

\aosafigure[180pt]{image-filters-images/sunflower.jpg}{Sunflower layout}{500l.imagefilters.sunflower}

You might think this would be discouraging, but by the time I got to this
point I had learned many things that hadn’t come my way before — about color
spaces and pixel manipulation — and I had started making those cool partially
colored images, the kind you find on postcards of London with a red bus or
phone booth and everything else in grayscale.

I used a framework called [Processing](https://processing.org/) because I was
familiar with it from developing programming curricula, and because I knew it
made it easy to create visual applications. It’s a tool originally
designed for artists, so it abstracts away much of the boilerplate. It allowed
me to play and experiment.

University, and later work, filled up my time with other people’s ideas and
priorities. Part of finishing this project was learning how to carve out time
to make progress on my own ideas; I required 
about four hours of good mental time a week. A tool that allowed me to
move faster was therefore really helpful, even necessary&mdash;although it came with
its own set of problems, especially around writing tests. 

I felt that thorough
tests were especially important for validating how the project was working, and for
making it easier to pick up and resume a project that was often on ice for
weeks, even months at a time. Tests (and blogposts!) formed the documentation
for this project. I could leave failing tests to document what should happen
that I hadn’t figured out yet, and make changes with confidence that if
I changed something that I had forgotten was critical, the tests would remind
me.

This chapter will cover some details about Processing and talk you through color
spaces, decomposing an image into pixels and manipulating them, and unit
testing something that wasn’t designed with testing in mind. But I hope it will
also prompt you to make some progress on whatever idea you haven’t made
time for lately; even if your idea turns out to be as terrible as mine
was, you may make something cool and learn something fascinating in the
process.

## The App

This chapter will show you how to create an image filter application
that you can use to
manipulate your digital images using filters that you create.
We'll use Processing, a programming language and development environment built in
Java. 
We’ll cover setting up the application in Processing, some of
the features of Processing, aspects of color representation, and how to create color filters (mimicking what was
used in old-fashioned photography). We'll also create a special kind of filter that
can only be done digitally: determining the dominant hue of an image and
showing or hiding it, to create eerie partially colored images.

Finally, we’ll add a thorough test suite, and cover how to handle some of
the limitations of Processing when it comes to testability.

## Background

Today we can take a photo, manipulate it, and share it with all our friends in
a matter of seconds. However, a long long time ago (in digital terms),
it was a process that took weeks.

In the old days, we would take the picture, then when we had used a whole roll of film, we would
take it in to be developed (often at the pharmacy). We'd pick up the developed pictures some days 
later&mdash;and discover that there was something wrong with many of them.
Hand not steady enough? Random person or thing that we didn’t notice at
the time? Overexposed? Underexposed? Of course by then it was too late to remedy the problem.

The process that turned the film into pictures was one that most people
didn’t understand. Light was a problem, so you had to be careful with the film.
There was a process, involving darkened rooms and chemicals, that they
sometimes showed in films or on TV.

But probably even fewer people understand how we get from the 
point-and-click on our smartphone camera to an image on Instagram. 
There are actually many similarities.

### Photographs, the Old Way

Photographs are created by the effect of light on a light-sensitive surface.
Photographic film is covered in silver halide crystals. (Extra layers are used
to create color photographs — for simplicity let’s just stick to
black-and-white photography here.) 

When talking an old-fashioned photograph — with film — the light hits the
film according to what you’re pointing at, and the crystals at those points are
changed in varying degrees, according to the amount of light. Then, the
[development
process](http://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/step-by-step-guide-to-developing-black-and-white-t-max-film--photo-2580)
converts the silver salts to metallic silver, creating the negative. The
negative has the light and dark areas of the image inverted. Once
the negatives have been developed, there is another series of steps to
reverse the image and print it.

### Photographs, the Digital Way

When taking pictures using our smartphones or digital cameras, there is no
film. There is something called an *active-pixel sensor* which functions in a
similar way. Where we used to have silver crystals, now we have pixels — tiny
squares. (In fact, pixel is short for "picture element".) Digital images are
made up of pixels, and the higher the resolution the more pixels there are.
This is why low-resolution images are described as "pixelated" — you can start
to see the squares. These pixels are stored in an array, with the number
in each array "box" containing the color.

In \aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.animals}, we see a high-resolution picture of some blow-up animals taken at
MoMA in NYC. \aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.pixelanimals} is
the same image blown up, but with just 24 x 32 pixels.

\aosafigure[180pt]{image-filters-images/animals.jpg}{Blow-up animals at MoMA NY}{500l.imagefilters.animals}

\aosafigure[180pt]{image-filters-images/pixelanimals.jpg}{Blow-up animals, blown up}{500l.imagefilters.pixelanimals}

See how it's so blurry? We call
that _pixelation_, which means the image is too big for the number of pixels it
contains and the squares become visible. Here we can use it to get a better
sense of an image being made up of squares of color.

What do these pixels look like? If we print out the colors of some of the
pixels in the middle (10,10 to 10,14) using the handy `Integer.toHexString` in
Java, we get hex colors:

```
FFE8B1
FFFAC4
FFFCC3
FFFCC2
FFF5B7
```

Hex colors are six characters long. The first two are the red value, the second
two the green value, and the third two the blue value. Sometimes there are an
extra two characters which are the alpha value. In this case `FFFAC4` means:

- red = FF (hex) = 255 (base 10)
- green = FA (hex) = 250 (base 10)
- blue = C4 (hex) = 196 (base 10)

## Running the App 

In \aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.app}, we have a picture of our app running.
It’s very much developer-designed, I know, but we only have 500 lines of Java
to work with so something had to suffer! You can see the list of commands on the right.
Some things we can do:

- Adjust the RGB filters.
- Adjust the “hue tolerance”.
- Set the dominant hue filters, to either show or hide the dominant hue.
- Apply our current setting (it is infeasible to run this every key press).
- Reset the image.
- Save the image we have made.

\aosafigure[240pt]{image-filters-images/app.jpg}{The App}{500l.imagefilters.app}

Processing makes it simple to create a little
application and do image manipulation;
it has a very visual focus. We’ll work with the Java-based version, although Processing has now been ported
to other languages (including Javascript which is awesome if you want to
upload your apps to the Internet).

For this tutorial, I use Processing in Eclipse by adding `core.jar` to my build path. If
you want, you can use the Processing IDE, which removes the need for a lot of
boilerplate Java code. If you later want to port it over to Processing.js and
upload it online, you need to replace the file chooser with something else.

There are detailed instructions with screenshots in the project's
[repository](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/blob/master/image-filters/SETUP.MD).
If you are familiar with Eclipse and Java already you may not need them.

## Processing Basics

### Size and Color

We don’t want our app to be a tiny grey window, so the two essential methods
that we will start by overriding are
[`setup()`](http://processing.org/reference/setup_.html), and
[`draw()`](http://processing.org/reference/draw_.html). The `setup()` method is
only called when the app starts, and is where we do things like set the size of
the app window.  The `draw()` method is called for every animation, or after
some action can be triggered by calling `redraw()`. (As covered in the
Processing Documentation, `draw()` should not be called explicitly.) 

Processing is designed to work nicely to create animated sketches, but in this
case we don’t want animation[^noanim], we want to respond to key presses. To prevent
animation (which would be a drag on performance) we will call
[`noLoop()`](http://www.processing.org/reference/noLoop_.html) from setup. This
means that `draw()` will only be called immediately after `setup()`, and
whenever we call `redraw()`.

[^noanim]: If we wanted to create an animated sketch we would not call
`noLoop()` (or, if we wanted to start animating later, we would call `loop()`).
The frequency of the animation is determined by `frameRate()`.

```java
private static final int WIDTH = 360;
private static final int HEIGHT = 240;

public void setup() {
  noLoop();

  // Set up the view.
  size(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  background(0);
}
    
public void draw() {
  background(0);
}
```

These don’t really do much yet, but try running the app again, adjusting the constants
in `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`, to see different sizes.

`background(0)` specifies a black background. Try changing the number passed
to `background()` and see what happens — it’s the alpha value, and so if you
only pass one number in, it is always greyscale. Alternatively, you can call
`background(int r, int g, int b)`.

### PImage

The [PImage object](http://processing.org/reference/PImage.html) is the
Processing object that represents an image. We’re going to be using this a lot,
so it’s worth reading through the documentation.  It has three fields
(\aosatblref{500l.imagefilters.pimagefields}) as well as some methods that we
will use (\aosatblref{500l.imagefilters.pimagemethods}).

<markdown>

  <tr>
    <td>`pixels[]`</td>
    <td>Array containing the color of every pixel in the image</td>
  </tr>

### File Chooser
Processing handles most of the file choosing process; we just need to call
[`selectInput()`](http://www.processing.org/reference/selectInput_.html), and
implement a callback (which must be public). 

To people familiar with Java this might seem odd; a listener or a lambda
expression might make more sense. However, as Processing was developed as a tool
for artists, for the most part these things have been
abstracted away by the language to keep it unintimidating. This is a choice the
designers made: to prioritize simplicity and approachability over power
and flexibility. If you use the stripped-down Processing editor, rather than
Processing as a library in Eclipse, you don’t even need to define class names. 

Other language designers with different target audiences make different
choices, as they should. For example, in Haskell, a purely
functional language, purity of functional language paradigms is
prioritised over everything else. This makes it a better tool for mathematical
problems than for anything requiring IO.

```java
// Called on key press.
private void chooseFile() {
  // Choose the file.
  selectInput("Select a file to process:", "fileSelected");
}

public void fileSelected(File file) {
  if (file == null) {
    println("User hit cancel.");
  } else {
    // save the image
    redraw(); // update the display
  }
}
```

### Responding to Key Presses

Normally in Java, responding to key presses requires adding listeners and implementing
anonymous functions. However, as with the file chooser, Processing handles a lot of
this for us. We just need to implement
[`keyPressed()`](https://www.processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html).

```java
public void keyPressed() {
  print(“key pressed: ” + key);
}
```

If you run the app again, every time you press a key it will output it to the
console. Later, you’ll want to do different things depending on what key was
pressed, and to do this you just switch on the key value. (This exists in the
`PApplet` superclass, and contains the last key pressed.) 


## Writing Tests 

This app doesn’t do a lot yet, but we can already see number of places where
things can go wrong; for example, triggering the wrong action with key presses.
As we add complexity, we add more potential problems, such as updating the
image state incorrectly, or miscalculating pixel colors after applying
a filter. I also just enjoy (some think weirdly) writing unit tests. Whilst
some people seem to think of testing as a thing that delays checking code in, I
see tests as my #1 debugging tool, and as an opportunity to deeply understand what
is going on in my code.

I adore Processing, but it’s designed to
create visual applications, and in this area maybe unit testing isn’t a huge
concern. It’s clear it isn’t written for testability; in fact it’s written in
such a way that makes it untestable, as is. Part of this is because it hides
complexity, and some of that hidden complexity is really useful in writing unit
tests. The use of static and final methods make it much harder to use mocks
(objects that record interaction and allow you to fake part of your system to
verify another part is behaving correctly), which rely on the ability to
subclass. 

We might start a greenfield project with great intentions to do Test Driven
Development (TDD) and achieve perfect test coverage, but in reality we are
usually looking at a mass of code written by various and assorted people and
trying to figure out what it is supposed to be doing, and how and why it is
going wrong. Then maybe we don’t write perfect tests, but writing tests at all
will help us navigate the situation, document what is happening and move
forward.

We create "seams" that allow us to break something up from its
amorphous mass of tangled pieces and verify it in parts. To do this, we will sometimes
create wrapper classes that can be mocked. These classes do nothing more than hold a
collection of similar methods, or forward calls on to another object that 
cannot be mocked (due to final or static methods), and as such they are 
very dull
to write, but key to creating seams and making the code testable.

I used JUnit for tests, as I was working in Java with Processing as a library.
For mocking I used Mockito. You can download
[Mockito](https://code.google.com/p/mockito/downloads/list) and add the JAR to
your buildpath in the same way you added `core.jar`. I created two helper
classes that make it possible to mock and test the app (otherwise we can’t test
behavior involving `PImage` or `PApplet` methods).

`IFAImage` is a thin wrapper around PImage. `PixelColorHelper` is a wrapper
around applet pixel color methods. These wrappers call the final, and static
methods, but the caller methods are neither final nor static themselves — this
allows them to be mocked. These are deliberately lightweight, and we could have
gone further, but this was sufficient to address the major problem of
testability when using Processing — static, and final methods. The goal 
was to make an app, after all — not a unit testing framework for Processing!

A class called `ImageState` forms the "model" of this application, removing as
much logic from the class extending `PApplet` as possible, for better
testability. It also makes for a cleaner design and separation of concerns:
the `App` controls the interactions and the UI, not the details of the image
manipulation.

## Do-It-Yourself Filters

### RGB Filters
Before we start writing more complicated pixel processing, we can start with a
short exercise that will get us comfortable doing pixel manipulation. We’ll
create standard (red, green, blue) color filters that will allow us to create
the same effect as placing a colored plate over the lens of a camera, only letting
through light with enough red (or green, or blue).

<markdown>
By applying different filters to this image
\aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.frankfurt} (taken on a spring trip to Frankfurt)
it’s almost like the seasons are different. (Remember the four-seasons
paintings we imagined earlier?)  See how much more green the tree becomes when
the red filter is applied.

\aosafigure[240pt]{image-filters-images/frankfurt.jpg}{Four (Simulated) Seasons in Frankfurt}{500l.imagefilters.frankfurt}
</markdown>
<latex>
By applying different RGB filters to an image we can make it almost seem like
the seasons are different depending which colors are filtered out 
and which are emphasized. (Remember the four-seasons paintings
we imagined earlier?) 
</latex>

How do we do it? 

- Set the filter. (You can combine red, green and blue filters as in the image
  earlier; I haven’t in these examples so that the effect is clearer.)

- For each pixel in the image, check its RGB value.

- If the red is less than the red filter, set the red to zero.
- If the green is less than the green filter, set the green to zero.
- If the blue is less than the blue filter, set the blue to zero.
- Any pixel with insufficient of all of these colors will be black.

Although our image is 2-dimensional, the pixels live in a 1-dimensional array
starting top-left and moving [left to right, top to
bottom](https://processing.org/tutorials/pixels/). The array indices for a 4x4
image are shown here:

  }
}
```

### Color
As our first example of an image filter showed, the concept and representation
of colors in a program is very important to understanding how our filters work.
To prepare ourselves for working on our next filter, let's explore the concept
of color a bit more.

We were using a concept
in the previous section called "color space", which is way of representing
color digitally. Kids mixing paints learn that colors can be made from
other colors; things work slightly differently in digital (less risk of
being covered in paint!) but similar. Processing makes it really easy to work
with whatever color space you want, but you need to know which one to pick, so
it’s important to understand how they work.

#### RGB colors
The color space that most programmers are familiar with is RGBA: red, green,
blue and alpha; it's what we were using above. In hexadecimal (base 16), the first two digits are the amount of
red, the second two blue, the third two green, and the final two (if they are
there) are the alpha value. The values range from 00 in base 16 (0 in base
10) through to FF (255 in base 10). The alpha represents 
opacity, where 0 is transparent and 100% is opaque.

#### HSB or HSV colors
This color space is not quite as well known as RGB. The first number represents
the hue, the second number the saturation (how intense the color is), and the third
number the brightness. The HSB color space can be represented by a cone: The hue
is the position around the cone, saturation the distance from the centre, and
brightness the height (0 brightness is black).

### Extracting the Dominant Hue from an Image
Now that we’re comfortable with pixel manipulation, let’s do something that we could
only do digitally. Digitally, we can manipulate the image in a way that isn’t so
uniform.

When I look through my stream of pictures I can see themes
emerging. The nighttime series I took at sunset from a boat on Hong Kong
harbour, the grey of North Korea, the lush greens of Bali, the icy whites and
pale blues of an Icelandic winter. Can we take a picture and pull out that main
color that dominates the scene?

It makes sense to use the HSB color space for this — we are interested in the
hue when figuring out what the main color
is. It’s possible to do this using RGB values, but more difficult (we would
have to compare all three values) and it would be more sensitive to darkness.
We can change to the HSB color space using
[colorMode](http://processing.org/reference/colorMode_.html). 

Having settled on this color space, it’s simpler than it would have been using
RGB. We need to find the hue of each pixel, and figure out which is most
"popular". We probably don’t want to be exact — we want to group very similar
hues together, and we can handle this using two strategies.

Firstly we will round the decimals that come back to whole numbers, as this
makes it simple to determine which "bucket" we put each pixel in. Secondly we
can change the range of the hues. If we think back to the cone representation above, we
might think of hues as having 360 degrees (like a circle). Processing uses 255
by default, which is the same as is typical for RGB (255 is FF in hexadecimal).
The higher the range we use, the more distinct the hues in the picture will be.
Using a smaller range will allow us to group together similar hues. Using a 360
degree range, it’s unlikely that we will be able to tell the difference between
a hue of 224 and a hue of 225, as the difference is very small. If we make the
range one-third of that instead, 120, both these hues become 75 after rounding.

We can change the range of hues using `colorMode`. If we call `colorMode(HSB, 120)`
we have just made our hue detection a bit less than half as exact as if we used
the 255 range. We also know that our hues will fall into 120 "buckets", so we
can simply go through our image, get the hue for a pixel, and add one to the
corresponding count in an array. This will be $O(n)$, where $n$ is the
number of pixels, as it requires action on each one.

```java
for(int px in pixels) {
  int hue = Math.round(hue(px));
  hues[hue]++;
}
```

<markdown>
At the end we can print this hue to the screen, or display it next to the
picture (\aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.hueranges}). 

\aosafigure[240pt]{image-filters-images/hueranges.jpg}{Dominant hue versus size of range (number of buckets) used}{500l.imagefilters.hueranges}

</markdown>

<latex>
At the end we can print this hue to the screen, or display it next to the
picture. 
</latex>

<markdown>
Once we’ve extracted the "dominant" hue, we can choose to either show or hide
it in the image. We can show the dominant hue with varying tolerance (ranges
around it that we will accept). Pixels that don’t fall into this range can be
changed to grayscale by setting the value based on the brightness.
\aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.showdominant} shows the dominant hue determined
using a range of 240, and with varying tolerance. The tolerance is the
amount either side of the most popular hue that gets grouped together.

around it that we will accept). Pixels that don’t fall into this range can be
changed to grayscale by setting the value based on the brightness.
Alternatively, we can hide the dominant hue by setting the color for pixels with that hue to greyscale, and leaving other pixels as they are.

Alternatively, we can hide the dominant hue. In
\aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.hidedominant}, the images are transposed side by
side: the original in the middle, on the left the dominant hue (the brownish color of the path) is shown, and on
the right the dominant hue is hidden (range 320, tolerance 20).

\aosafigure[240pt]{image-filters-images/hidedominant.jpg}{Hiding dominant hue}{500l.imagefilters.hidedominant}
</markdown>

Each image requires a double pass (looking at each pixel twice), so on images
with a large number of pixels it can take a noticeable amount of time.

```java
public HSBColor getDominantHue(PApplet applet, IFAImage image, int hueRange) {
  image.loadPixels();
  int numberOfPixels = image.getPixels().length;
  int[] hues = new int[hueRange];
  float[] saturations = new float[hueRange];
  float[] brightnesses = new float[hueRange];

  for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPixels; i++) {
    int pixel = image.getPixel(i);
    int hue = Math.round(pixelColorHelper.hue(applet, pixel));
    float saturation = pixelColorHelper.saturation(applet, pixel);
    float brightness = pixelColorHelper.brightness(applet, pixel);
    hues[hue]++;
    saturations[hue] += saturation;
    brightnesses[hue] += brightness;
  }

  // Find the most common hue.
  int hueCount = hues[0];
  int hue = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < hues.length; i++) {
    if (hues[i] > hueCount) {
      hueCount = hues[i];
      hue = i;
    }
  }

  // Return the color to display.
  float s = saturations[hue] / hueCount;
  float b = brightnesses[hue] / hueCount;
  return new HSBColor(hue, s, b);
}


public void processImageForHue(PApplet applet, IFAImage image, int hueRange,
    int hueTolerance, boolean showHue) {
  applet.colorMode(PApplet.HSB, (hueRange - 1));
  image.loadPixels();
  int numberOfPixels = image.getPixels().length;
  HSBColor dominantHue = getDominantHue(applet, image, hueRange);
  // Manipulate photo, grayscale any pixel that isn't close to that hue.
  float lower = dominantHue.h - hueTolerance;
  float upper = dominantHue.h + hueTolerance;
  for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPixels; i++) {
    int pixel = image.getPixel(i);
    float hue = pixelColorHelper.hue(applet, pixel);
    if (hueInRange(hue, hueRange, lower, upper) == showHue) {
      float brightness = pixelColorHelper.brightness(applet, pixel);
      image.setPixel(i, pixelColorHelper.color(applet, brightness));
    }
  }
  image.updatePixels();
}
```

### Combining Filters

With the UI as it is, the user can combine the red, green, and blue filters
together. If they combine the dominant hue filters with the red, green, and
blue filters the results can sometimes be a little unexpected, because of
changing the color spaces.

Processing has some [built-in
methods](https://www.processing.org/reference/filter_.html) that support the
manipulation of images; for example, `invert` and `blur`.

To achieve effects like sharpening, blurring, or sepia we apply
matrices. For every pixel of the image, take the sum of products where each
product is the color value of the current pixel or a neighbor of it, with the
corresponding value of the [filter
matrix](http://lodev.org/cgtutor/filtering.html). There are some special
matrices of specific values that sharpen images.

## Architecture

There are three main components to the app (\aosafigref{500l.imagefilters.architecture}).

### The App
The app consists of one file: `ImageFilterApp.java`. This 
extends `PApplet` (the
Processing app superclass) and handles layout, user interaction, etc. This class
is the hardest to test, so we want to keep it as small as possible.

### Model
Model consists of three files: `HSBColor.java` is a simple container for HSB
colors (consisting of hue, saturation, and brightness). `IFAImage` is a
wrapper around `PImage` for testability. (`PImage` contains a number of final
methods which cannot be mocked.) Finally, `ImageState.java` is the object
which describes the state of the image — what level of filters should be applied,
and which filters — and handles loading the image. (Note: The image needs to be reloaded
whenever color filters are adjusted down, and whenever the dominant hue is
recalculated. For clarity, we just reload each time the image is processed.)

### Color
Color consists of two files: `ColorHelper.java` is where all the image
processing and filtering takes place, and `PixelColorHelper.java` 
abstracts out final `PApplet` methods for pixel colors for testability.

\aosafigure[240pt]{image-filters-images/architecture.jpg}{Architecture diagram}{500l.imagefilters.architecture}

### Wrapper Classes and Tests
Briefly mentioned above, there are two wrapper classes (`IFAImage` and
`PixelColorHelper`) that wrap library methods for testability. This is because,
in Java, the keyword "final" indicates a method that cannot be overridden or hidden by
subclasses, which means they cannot be mocked.

`PixelColorHelper` wraps methods on the applet. This means we need to pass the
applet in to each method call. (Alternatively, we could make it a field and set
it on initialization.)

```java
package com.catehuston.imagefilter.color;

import processing.core.PApplet;

public class PixelColorHelper {

  public float alpha(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.alpha(pixel);
  }

  public float blue(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.blue(pixel);
  }

  public float brightness(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.brightness(pixel);
  }

  public int color(PApplet applet, float greyscale) {
    return applet.color(greyscale);
  }

  public int color(PApplet applet, float red, float green, float blue,
           float alpha) {
    return applet.color(red, green, blue, alpha);
  }

  public float green(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.green(pixel);
  }

  public float hue(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.hue(pixel);
  }

  public float red(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.red(pixel);
  }

  public float saturation(PApplet applet, int pixel) {
    return applet.saturation(pixel);
  }
}
```

`IFAImage` is a wrapper around `PImage`, so in our app we don’t initialize a
`PImage`, but rather an `IFAImage` — although we do have to expose the
`PImage` so that it can be rendered.

```java
package com.catehuston.imagefilter.model;

import processing.core.PApplet;
import processing.core.PImage;

public class IFAImage {

  private PImage image;

  public IFAImage() {
    image = null;
  }

  public PImage image() {
    return image;
  }

  public void update(PApplet applet, String filepath) {
    image = null;
    image = applet.loadImage(filepath);
  }

  // Wrapped methods from PImage.
  public int getHeight() {
    return image.height;
  }

  public int getPixel(int px) {
    return image.pixels[px];
  }

  public int[] getPixels() {
    return image.pixels;
  }

  public int getWidth() {
    return image.width;
  }

  public void loadPixels() {
    image.loadPixels();
  }

  public void resize(int width, int height) {
    image.resize(width, height);
  }

  public void save(String filepath) {
    image.save(filepath);
  }

  public void setPixel(int px, int color) {
    image.pixels[px] = color;
  }

  public void updatePixels() {
    image.updatePixels();
  }
}
```

Finally, we have our simple container class, `HSBColor`. Note that it is
immutable (once created, it cannot be changed). Immutable objects are better
for thread safety (something we have no need of here!) but are also easier to
understand and reason about. In general, I tend to make simple model classes
immutable unless I find a good reason for them not to be, and in this case no
such reason arose.

Some of you may know that there are already classes representing color in
[Processing](https://www.processing.org/reference/color_datatype.html) and in
[Java itself](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html).
Without going too much into the details of these, both of them are more focused
on RGB color, and the Java class in particular adds way more complexity than we
need. We would probably be okay if we did want to use Java’s `awt.Color`; however
[awt GUI components cannot be used in
Processing](http://processing.org/reference/javadoc/core/processing/core/PApplet.html),
so for our purposes creating this simple container class to hold these
bits of data we need is easiest.

```java
package com.catehuston.imagefilter.model;

public class HSBColor {

  public final float h;
  public final float s;
  public final float b;

  public HSBColor(float h, float s, float b) {
    this.h = h;
    this.s = s;
    this.b = b;
  }
}
```

### ColorHelper and Associated Tests

`ColorHelper` is where all the image manipulation lives. The methods in this
class could be static if not for needing a `PixelColorHelper`. (Although we
won’t get into the debate about the merits of static methods here.)

```java
package com.catehuston.imagefilter.color;

import processing.core.PApplet;

import com.catehuston.imagefilter.model.HSBColor;
import com.catehuston.imagefilter.model.IFAImage;

public class ColorHelper {

  private final PixelColorHelper pixelColorHelper;

  public ColorHelper(PixelColorHelper pixelColorHelper) {
    this.pixelColorHelper = pixelColorHelper;
  }

  public boolean hueInRange(float hue, int hueRange, float lower, float upper) {
    // Need to compensate for it being circular - can go around.
    if (lower < 0) {
      lower += hueRange;
    }
    if (upper > hueRange) {
      upper -= hueRange;
    }
    if (lower < upper) {
      return hue < upper && hue > lower;
    } else {
      return hue < upper || hue > lower;
    }
  }

  public HSBColor getDominantHue(PApplet applet, IFAImage image, int hueRange) {
    image.loadPixels();
    int numberOfPixels = image.getPixels().length;
    int[] hues = new int[hueRange];
    float[] saturations = new float[hueRange];
    float[] brightnesses = new float[hueRange];

    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPixels; i++) {
      int pixel = image.getPixel(i);
      int hue = Math.round(pixelColorHelper.hue(applet, pixel));
      float saturation = pixelColorHelper.saturation(applet, pixel);
      float brightness = pixelColorHelper.brightness(applet, pixel);
      hues[hue]++;
      saturations[hue] += saturation;
      brightnesses[hue] += brightness;
    }

    // Find the most common hue.
    int hueCount = hues[0];
    int hue = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < hues.length; i++) {
      if (hues[i] > hueCount) {
        hueCount = hues[i];
        hue = i;
      }
    }

    // Return the color to display.
    float s = saturations[hue] / hueCount;
    float b = brightnesses[hue] / hueCount;
    return new HSBColor(hue, s, b);
  }

  public void processImageForHue(PApplet applet, IFAImage image, int hueRange,
      int hueTolerance, boolean showHue) {
    applet.colorMode(PApplet.HSB, (hueRange - 1));
    image.loadPixels();
    int numberOfPixels = image.getPixels().length;
    HSBColor dominantHue = getDominantHue(applet, image, hueRange);
    // Manipulate photo, grayscale any pixel that isn't close to that hue.
    float lower = dominantHue.h - hueTolerance;
    float upper = dominantHue.h + hueTolerance;
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPixels; i++) {
      int pixel = image.getPixel(i);
      float hue = pixelColorHelper.hue(applet, pixel);
      if (hueInRange(hue, hueRange, lower, upper) == showHue) {
        float brightness = pixelColorHelper.brightness(applet, pixel);
        image.setPixel(i, pixelColorHelper.color(applet, brightness));
      }
    }
    image.updatePixels();
  }

  public void applyColorFilter(PApplet applet, IFAImage image, int minRed,
      int minGreen, int minBlue, int colorRange) {
    applet.colorMode(PApplet.RGB, colorRange);
    image.loadPixels();
    int numberOfPixels = image.getPixels().length;
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfPixels; i++) {
      int pixel = image.getPixel(i);
      float alpha = pixelColorHelper.alpha(applet, pixel);
      float red = pixelColorHelper.red(applet, pixel);
      float green = pixelColorHelper.green(applet, pixel);
      float blue = pixelColorHelper.blue(applet, pixel);

      red = (red >= minRed) ? red : 0;
      green = (green >= minGreen) ? green : 0;
      blue = (blue >= minBlue) ? blue : 0;

      image.setPixel(i, pixelColorHelper.color(applet, red, green, blue, alpha));
    }
  }
}
```

We don't want to test this with whole images, because we want images that we
know the properties of and reason about. We approximate this by mocking the
images and making them return an array of pixels — in this case, 5. This
allows us to
verify that the behavior is as expected. Earlier we covered the concept of mock
objects, and here we see their use. We are using
[Mockito](http://docs.mockito.googlecode.com/hg/org/mockito/Mockito.html) as
our mock object framework.

To create a mock we use the `@Mock` annotation on an instance variable, and it will be mocked at runtime by the
`MockitoJUnitRunner`.

To stub (set the behavior of) a method, we use: 

```java
    when(mock.methodCall()).thenReturn(value)
```

To verify a method was called, we use `verify(mock.methodCall())`.

We'll show a few example test cases here; if you'd like to see the rest, visit
the source folder for this project in the [_500 Lines or Less_ GitHub
repository](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/tree/master/image-filters).

Notice that:

- We use the `MockitoJUnit` runner.
- We mock `PApplet`, `IFAImage` (created for expressly this purpose), and `ImageColorHelper`.
- Test methods are annotated with `@Test`[^habits]. If you want to ignore a test (e.g., whilst debugging) you can add the annotation `@Ignore`.
- In `setup()`, we create the pixel array and have the mock image always return it.
- Helper methods make it easier to set expectations for recurring tasks (e.g., `set*ForPixel()`).

[^habits]: Method names in tests need not start with `test` as of JUnit 4, but habits are hard to break.

### Image State and Associated Tests
`ImageState` holds the current "state" of the image — the image itself, and the
settings and filters that will be applied. We'll omit the full implementation
of `ImageState` here, but we'll show how it can be tested. You can visit the source
repository for this project to see the full implementation details.

```java
package com.catehuston.imagefilter.model;

import processing.core.PApplet;
import com.catehuston.imagefilter.color.ColorHelper;

public class ImageState {

  enum ColorMode {
    COLOR_FILTER,
    SHOW_DOMINANT_HUE,
    HIDE_DOMINANT_HUE
  }

  private final ColorHelper colorHelper;
  private IFAImage image;
  private String filepath;

  public static final int INITIAL_HUE_TOLERANCE = 5;

  ColorMode colorModeState = ColorMode.COLOR_FILTER;
  int blueFilter = 0;
  int greenFilter = 0;
  int hueTolerance = 0;
  int redFilter = 0;

  public ImageState(ColorHelper colorHelper) {
    this.colorHelper = colorHelper;
    image = new IFAImage();
    hueTolerance = INITIAL_HUE_TOLERANCE;
  }
  /* ... getters & setters */
  public void updateImage(PApplet applet, int hueRange, int rgbColorRange, 
          int imageMax) { ... }

  public void processKeyPress(char key, int inc, int rgbColorRange,
          int hueIncrement, int hueRange) { ... }

  public void setUpImage(PApplet applet, int imageMax) { ... }

  public void resetImage(PApplet applet, int imageMax) { ... }

  // For testing purposes only.
  protected void set(IFAImage image, ColorMode colorModeState,
            int redFilter, int greenFilter, int blueFilter, int hueTolerance) { ... }
}
```

Here we can test that the appropriate actions happen for the given state; that
fields are incremented and decremented appropriately.

```java
package com.catehuston.imagefilter.model;

/* ... Imports omitted ... */

    imageState = new ImageState(colorHelper);
  }

  private void assertState(ColorMode colorMode, int redFilter,
      int greenFilter, int blueFilter, int hueTolerance) {
    assertEquals(colorMode, imageState.getColorMode());
    assertEquals(redFilter, imageState.redFilter());
    assertEquals(greenFilter, imageState.greenFilter());
    assertEquals(blueFilter, imageState.blueFilter());
    assertEquals(hueTolerance, imageState.hueTolerance());
  }

    verify(image).updatePixels();
  }

    verify(image).updatePixels();
  }

Notice that:

- We exposed a protected initialization method `set` for testing that helps us quickly get the system under test into a specific state.
- We mock `PApplet`, `ColorHelper`, and `IFAImage` (created expressly for this purpose).
- This time we use a helper method (`assertState()`) to simplify asserting the state of the image.

#### Measuring test coverage
I use [EclEmma](http://www.eclemma.org/installation.html#marketplace) to
measure test coverage within Eclipse. It can be installed from the Eclipse
marketplace.

Overall for the app we have 81% test coverage, with none of `ImageFilterApp`
covered, 94.8% for `ImageState`, and 100% for `ColorHelper`.

### ImageFilterApp
This is where everything is tied together, but we want as little as possible
here. The App is hard to unit test (much of it is layout), but because we've pushed so much of the app's functionality into our own tested classes, we're able to assure ourselves that the important parts are working as intended.  

We set the size of the app, and do the layout. (These things are verified by
running the app and making sure it looks okay — no matter how good the test coverage,
this step should not be skipped!)

    redraw();
  }

  private void chooseFile() {
    // Choose the file.
    selectInput("Select a file to process:", "fileSelected");
  }
}
```

Notice that:

- Our implementation extends `PApplet`.
- Most work is done in `ImageState`.
- `fileSelected()` is the callback for `selectInput()`.
- `static final` constants are defined up at the top.

## The Value of Prototyping
In real world programming, we spend a lot of time on productionisation work.
Making things look just so. Maintaining that 99.9%
uptime. We spend more time hunting down corner cases than refining algorithms.

These constraints and requirements are important for our users. However there’s
also space for freeing ourselves from them to play and explore.

Eventually, I decided to port this to a native mobile app. Processing has an
Android library, but as many mobile developers do, I opted to go iOS first. I
had years of iOS experience, although I’d done little with CoreGraphics, but I
don’t think even if I had had this idea initially, I would have been able to
build it straight away on iOS. The platform forced me to operate in the RGB
color space, and made it hard to extract the pixels from the image (hello, C).
Memory and waiting was a major risk factor. 

There were exhilarating moments,
when it worked for the first time. When it first ran on my device… without
crashing. When I optimized memory usage by 66% and cut seconds off the runtime.
And there were large periods of time locked away in a dark room, cursing
intermittently.

Because I had my prototype, I could explain to my business partner and our
designer what I was thinking and what the app would do. It meant I deeply
understood how it would work, and it was just a question of making it work
nicely on this other platform. I knew what I was aiming for, so at the end of a
long day shut away fighting with it and feeling like I had little to show for
it I kept going… and hit an exhilarating moment and milestone the following
morning.

So, how do you extract the dominant color from an image? There’s an app for
that: [Show & Hide](http://showandhide.com).
