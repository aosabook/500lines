## Introduction

DBDB (Dog Bed Database) is a Python library that implements a simple key/value database.
It lets you associate a key with a value,
and store that association on disk for later retrieval.

DBDB aims to preserve data in the face of computer crashes
and error conditions.
It also avoids holding all data in RAM at once
so you can store more data than you have RAM.


## Memory

I remember the first time I was really stuck on a bug. When I finished
typing in my BASIC program and ran it, weird sparkly pixels showed up on the
screen, and the program aborted early. When I went back to look at the code,
the last few lines of the program were gone. 

One of my mom's friends knew how to program, so we set up a call. Within a few
minutes of speaking with her, I found the problem: the program was too big, and
had encroached onto video memory. Clearing the screen truncated the program,
and the sparkles were artifacts of Applesoft BASIC's behaviour of storing
program state in RAM just beyond the end of the program.

From that moment onwards, I cared about memory allocation.  I
learned about pointers and how to allocate memory with malloc. I learned how my
data structures were laid out in memory. And I learned to be very, very careful
about how I changed them.

Some years later, while reading about a process-oriented language called
Erlang, I learned that it didn't actually have to copy data to send messages
between processes, because everything was immutable. I then discovered
immutable data structures in Clojure, and it really began to sink in. 

When I read about CouchDB in 2013, I just smiled and nodded,
recognising the structures and mechanisms for managing complex data as it
changes.

I learned that you can design systems built around immutable data.

Then I agreed to write a book chapter.

I thought that describing the core data storage concepts of CouchDB
(as I understood them)
would be fun.

While trying to write a binary tree
algorithm that mutated the tree in place, I got frustrated with how complicated
things were getting. The number of edge cases and trying to reason about how
changes in one part of the tree affected others was making my head hurt. I had
no idea how I was going to explain all of this.

Remembering lessons learned, I took a peek at a recursive algorithm for
updating immutable binary trees
and it turned out to be relatively straightforward.

I learned, once again, that it's easier to reason about things that don't change.

So starts the story.


## Why Is it Interesting?

Most projects require a database of some kind.
You really shouldn't write your own;
there are many edge cases that will bite you,
even if you're just writing JSON to disk:

* What happens if your filesystem runs out of space?
* What happens if your laptop battery dies while saving?
* What if your data size exceeds available memory?
  (Unlikely for most applications on modern desktop computers&hellip; but
  not unlikely for a mobile device or server-side web application.)

However, if you want to _understand_ how a database handles all of these
problems, writing one for yourself can be a good idea. 

The techniques and concepts we discuss here
should be applicable to any problem
that needs to have rational, predictable behaviour
when faced with failure.

Speaking of failure...


## Characterizing Failure

Databases are often characterized by how closely they adhere to
the ACID properties:
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

Updates in DBDB are atomic and durable,
two attributes which are described later in the chapter.
DBDB provides no consistency guarantees
as there are no constraints on the data stored.
Isolation is likewise not implemented.

<latex>
Application code can, of course, impose its own consistency guarantees, but
proper isolation requires a transaction manager. We won't attempt that here;
however, you can learn more about transaction management in the CircleDB
chapter (\aosachapref{s:functionalDB}).

We also have other system-maintenance problems to think about. 
Stale data is not reclaimed in this implementation,
so repeated updates
(even to the same key)
will eventually consume all disk space. (You will shortly discover why this is the case.)
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) calls this reclamation "vacuuming"
(which makes old row space available for re-use),
and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) calls it "compaction"
(by rewriting the "live" parts of the data into a new file,
and atomically moving it over the old one).

DBDB could be enhanced to add a compaction feature,
but it is left as an exercise for the reader[^bonus]. 

[^bonus]: Bonus feature: Can you guarantee that the compacted tree structure is
balanced?  This helps maintain performance over time.


## The Architecture of DBDB

DBDB separates the concerns of "put this on disk somewhere"
(how data are laid out in a file; the physical layer)
from the logical structure of the data
(a binary tree in this example; the logical layer)
from the contents of the key/value store
(the association of key `a` to value `foo`; the public API).

Many databases separate the logical and physical aspects
as it is is often useful to provide alternative implementations of each
to get different performance characteristics,
e.g. DB2's SMS (files in a filesystem) versus DMS (raw block device) tablespaces,
or MySQL's [alternative engine implementations](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/storage-engines.html).

## Discovering the Design

Most of the chapters in this book describe how a program was built from
inception to completion. However, that is not how most of us interact with the
code we're working on.
We most often discover code that was written by others,
and figure out how to modify or extend it to do something different.

In this chapter, we'll assume that DBDB is a completed project, and walk
through it to learn how it works. Let's explore the structure of the entire
project first.

### Organisational Units

Units are ordered here by distance from the end user; that is, the first module
is the one that a user of this program would likely need to know the most
about, while the last is something they should have very little interaction
with.

* ``tool.py`` defines
    a command-line tool
    for exploring a database
    from a terminal window.

* ``interface.py`` defines
    a class (``DBDB``)
    which implements the Python dictionary API
    using the concrete ``BinaryTree`` implementation.
    This is how you'd use DBDB inside a Python program.

* ``logical.py`` defines
    the logical layer.
    It's an abstract interface to a key/value store.

    - ``LogicalBase`` provides the API for logical updates
        (like get, set, and commit)
        and defers to a concrete subclass
        to implement the updates themselves.
        It also manages storage locking
        and dereferencing internal nodes.

    - ``ValueRef`` is a Python object that refers to
        a binary blob stored in the database.
        The indirection lets us avoid loading
        the entire data store into memory all at once.

* ``binary_tree.py`` defines
    a concrete binary tree algorithm
    underneath the logical interface.

    - ``BinaryTree`` provides a concrete implementation
        of a binary tree, with methods for
        getting, inserting, and deleting key/value pairs.
        ``BinaryTree`` represents an immutable tree;
        updates are performed by returning a new tree
        which shares common structure with the old one.

    - ``BinaryNode`` implements a node in the binary tree.

    - ``BinaryNodeRef`` is a specialised ``ValueRef``
        which knows how to serialise and deserialise
        a ``BinaryNode``.

* ``physical.py`` defines
    the physical layer.
    The ``Storage`` class
    provides persistent, (mostly) append-only record storage.

These modules grew from attempting
to give each class a single responsibility.
In other words,
each class should have only one reason to change.


### Reading a Value

We'll start with the simplest case: reading a value from the database. Let's see what happens
when we try to get the value associated with key ``foo`` in ``example.db``:

```bash
$ python -m dbdb.tool example.db get foo
```

This runs the ``main()`` function from module ``dbdb.tool``:
```python
# dbdb/tool.py
def main(argv):
    if not (4 <= len(argv) <= 5):
        usage()
        return BAD_ARGS
    dbname, verb, key, value = (argv[1:] + [None])[:4]
    if verb not in {'get', 'set', 'delete'}:
        usage()
        return BAD_VERB
    db = dbdb.connect(dbname)          # CONNECT
    try:
        if verb == 'get':
            sys.stdout.write(db[key])  # GET VALUE
        elif verb == 'set':
            db[key] = value
            db.commit()
        else:
            del db[key]
            db.commit()
    except KeyError:
        print("Key not found", file=sys.stderr)
        return BAD_KEY
    return OK
```

The ``connect()`` function
opens the database file
(possibly creating it,
but never overwriting it)
and returns an instance of ``DBDB``:
```python
# dbdb/__init__.py
def connect(dbname):
    try:
        f = open(dbname, 'r+b')
    except IOError:
        fd = os.open(dbname, os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT)
        f = os.fdopen(fd, 'r+b')
    return DBDB(f)
```

```python
# dbdb/interface.py
class DBDB(object):

    def __init__(self, f):
        self._storage = Storage(f)
        self._tree = BinaryTree(self._storage)
```

We see right away that `DBDB` has a reference to an instance of `Storage`, but
it also shares that reference with `self._tree`. Why? Can't `self._tree`
manage access to the storage by itself? 

The question of which objects "own" a resource is often an important one in a
design, because it gives us hints about what changes might be unsafe. Let's
keep that question in mind as we move on.

Once we have a DBDB instance, getting the value at ``key`` is done via a
dictionary lookup (``db[key]``), which causes the Python interpreter to call
``DBDB.__getitem__()``.
```python
# dbdb/interface.py
class DBDB(object):
# ...
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        self._assert_not_closed()
        return self._tree.get(key)

    def _assert_not_closed(self):
        if self._storage.closed:
            raise ValueError('Database closed.')
```

``__getitem__()`` ensures that the database is still open by calling
`_assert_not_closed`. Aha! Here we see at least one reason why `DBDB` needs
direct access to our `Storage` instance: so it can enforce preconditions.
(Do you agree with this design? Can you think of a different way that we could
do this?)

DBDB then retrieves the value associated with ``key`` on the internal ``_tree``
by calling ``_tree.get()``, which is provided by ``LogicalBase``:

```python
# dbdb/logical.py
class LogicalBase(object):
# ...
    def get(self, key):
        if not self._storage.locked:
            self._refresh_tree_ref()
        return self._get(self._follow(self._tree_ref), key)
```

``get()`` checks if we have the storage locked. We're not 100% sure _why_
there might be a lock here, but we can guess that it probably exists to allow
writers to serialize access to the data. What happens if the storage isn't locked?

```python
# dbdb/logical.py
class LogicalBase(object):
# ...
def _refresh_tree_ref(self):
        self._tree_ref = self.node_ref_class(
            address=self._storage.get_root_address())
```

`_refresh_tree_ref` resets the tree's "view" of the data with what is currently
on disk, allowing us to perform a completely up-to-date read.

What if storage _is_ locked when we attempt a read? This means that some other
process is probably changing the data we want to read right now; our read is
not likely to be up-to-date with the current state of the data. This is
generally known as a "dirty read". This pattern allows many readers to access
data without ever worrying about blocking, at the expense of being slightly
out-of-date.

For now, let's take a look at how we actually retrieve the data:
```python
# dbdb/binary_tree.py
class BinaryTree(LogicalBase):
# ...
    def _get(self, node, key):
        while node is not None:
            if key < node.key:
                node = self._follow(node.left_ref)
            elif node.key < key:
                node = self._follow(node.right_ref)
            else:
                return self._follow(node.value_ref)
        raise KeyError
```
This is a standard binary tree search, following refs to their nodes. We know
from reading the ``BinaryTree`` documentation that 
``Node``s and ``NodeRef``s are value objects:
they are immutable and their contents never change.
``Node``s are created
with an associated key and value,
and left and right children.
Those associations also never change.
The content of the whole ``BinaryTree`` only visibly changes
when the root node is replaced.
This means that we don't need to worry about the contents of our tree being
changed while we are performing the search. 

Once the associated value is found, 
it is written to ``stdout`` by ``main()``
without adding any extra newlines,
to preserve the user's data exactly.


#### Inserting and Updating

Now we'll set key ``foo`` to value ``bar`` in ``example.db``:
```bash
$ python -m dbdb.tool example.db set foo bar
```

Again, this runs the ``main()`` function from module ``dbdb.tool``. Since we've
seen this code before, we'll just highlight the important parts:
```python
# dbdb/tool.py
def main(argv):
    ...
    db = dbdb.connect(dbname)          # CONNECT
    try:
        ...
        elif verb == 'set':
            db[key] = value            # SET VALUE
            db.commit()                # COMMIT
        ...
    except KeyError:
        ...
```

This time we set the value with ``db[key] = value``
which calls ``DBDB.__setitem__()``.
```python
# dbdb/interface.py
class DBDB(object):
# ...
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        self._assert_not_closed()
        return self._tree.set(key, value)
```

``__setitem__`` ensures that the database is still open
and then stores the association from ``key`` to ``value``
on the internal ``_tree`` by calling ``_tree.set()``.

``_tree.set()`` is provided by ``LogicalBase``:
```python
# dbdb/logical.py
class LogicalBase(object):
# ...
    def set(self, key, value):
        if self._storage.lock():
            self._refresh_tree_ref()
        self._tree_ref = self._insert(
            self._follow(self._tree_ref), key, self.value_ref_class(value))
```

``set()`` first checks the storage lock:

```python
# dbdb/storage.py
class Storage(object):
    ...
    def lock(self):
        if not self.locked:
            portalocker.lock(self._f, portalocker.LOCK_EX)
            self.locked = True
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

There are two important things to note here: 

 - Our lock is provided by a 3rd-party file-locking library called
   [portalocker](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/portalocker).
 - `lock()` returns `False` if the database was already locked, and `True`
   otherwise.

Returning to `_tree.set()`, we can now understand why it checked the
return value of `lock()` in the first place: it lets us call
`_refresh_tree_ref` for the most recent root node reference
so we don't lose updates that another process may have made
since we last refreshed the tree from disk.
Then it replaces the root tree node
with a new tree containing the inserted (or updated) key/value.

Inserting or updating the tree doesn't mutate any nodes,
because ``_insert()`` returns a new tree.
The new tree shares unchanged parts with the previous tree
to save on memory and execution time.
It's natural to implement this recursively:
```python
# dbdb/binary_tree.py
class BinaryTree(LogicalBase):
# ...
    def _insert(self, node, key, value_ref):
        if node is None:
            new_node = BinaryNode(
                self.node_ref_class(), key, value_ref, self.node_ref_class(), 1)
        elif key < node.key:
            new_node = BinaryNode.from_node(
                node,
                left_ref=self._insert(
                    self._follow(node.left_ref), key, value_ref))
        elif node.key < key:
            new_node = BinaryNode.from_node(
                node,
                right_ref=self._insert(
                    self._follow(node.right_ref), key, value_ref))
        else:
            new_node = BinaryNode.from_node(node, value_ref=value_ref)
        return self.node_ref_class(referent=new_node)
```

Notice how we always return a new node
(wrapped in a ``NodeRef``).
Instead of updating a node to point to a new subtree,
we make a new node which shares the unchanged subtree.
This is what makes this binary tree an immutable data structure.

You may have noticed something strange here: we haven't made any changes to
anything on disk yet. All we've done is manipulate our view of the on-disk data
by moving tree nodes around.

In order to actually write these changes to disk, we need an explicit call to
`commit()`, which we saw as the second part of our `set` operation in `tool.py`
at the beginning of this section. 

Committing involves writing out all of the dirty state in memory,
and then saving the disk address of the tree's new root node. 

Starting from the API:
```python
# dbdb/interface.py
class DBDB(object):
# ...
    def commit(self):
        self._assert_not_closed()
        self._tree.commit()
```

The implementation of ``_tree.commit()`` comes from ``LogicalBase``:
```python
# dbdb/logical.py
class LogicalBase(object)
# ...
    def commit(self):
        self._tree_ref.store(self._storage)
        self._storage.commit_root_address(self._tree_ref.address)
```

All ``NodeRef``s know how to serialise themselves to disk
by first asking their children to serialise via ``prepare_to_store()``:
```python
# dbdb/logical.py
class ValueRef(object):
# ...
    def store(self, storage):
        if self._referent is not None and not self._address:
            self.prepare_to_store(storage)
            self._address = storage.write(self.referent_to_string(self._referent))
```

``self._tree_ref`` in ``LogicalBase`` is actually a ``BinaryNodeRef``
(a subclass of ``ValueRef``) in this case,
so the concrete implementation of ``prepare_to_store()`` is:
```python
# dbdb/binary_tree.py
class BinaryNodeRef(ValueRef):
    def prepare_to_store(self, storage):
        if self._referent:
            self._referent.store_refs(storage)
```

The ``BinaryNode`` in question, ``_referent``,
asks its refs to store themselves:
```python
# dbdb/binary_tree.py
class BinaryNode(object):
# ...
    def store_refs(self, storage):
        self.value_ref.store(storage)
        self.left_ref.store(storage)
        self.right_ref.store(storage)
```

This recurses all the way down for any ``NodeRef``
which has unwritten changes (i.e., no ``_address``).

Now we're back up the stack in `ValueRef`'s `store` method again. 
The last step of ``store()`` is to serialise this node
and save its storage address:
```python
# dbdb/logical.py
class ValueRef(object):
# ...
    def store(self, storage):
        if self._referent is not None and not self._address:
            self.prepare_to_store(storage)
            self._address = storage.write(self.referent_to_string(self._referent))
```

At this point
the ``NodeRef``'s ``_referent`` is guaranteed to have addresses available for all of its own refs,
so we serialise it by creating a bytestring representing this node:
```python
# dbdb/binary_tree.py
class BinaryNodeRef(ValueRef):
# ...
    @staticmethod
    def referent_to_string(referent):
        return pickle.dumps({
            'left': referent.left_ref.address,
            'key': referent.key,
            'value': referent.value_ref.address,
            'right': referent.right_ref.address,
            'length': referent.length,
        })
```

Updating the address in the ``store()`` method
is technically a mutation of the ``ValueRef``.
Because it has no effect on the user-visible value,
we can consider it to be immutable.

Once ``store()`` on the root ``_tree_ref`` is complete
(in ``LogicalBase.commit()``),
we know that all of the data are written to disk.
We can now commit the root address by calling:
```python
# dbdb/physical.py
class Storage(object):
# ...
    def commit_root_address(self, root_address):
        self.lock()
        self._f.flush()
        self._seek_superblock()
        self._write_integer(root_address)
        self._f.flush()
        self.unlock()
```

We ensure that the file handle is flushed
(so that the OS knows we want all the data saved to stable storage like an SSD)
and write out the address of the root node.
We know this last write is atomic because we store the disk address on a sector boundary.
It's the very first thing in the file,
so this is true regardless of sector size,
and single-sector disk writes are guaranteed to be atomic by the disk hardware.

Because the root node address has either the old or new value
(never a bit of old and a bit of new),
other processes can read from the database without getting a lock.
An external process might see the old or the new tree,
but never a mix of the two.
In this way, commits are atomic.

Because we write the new data to disk and call the ``fsync`` syscall[^fsync]
before we write the root node address,
uncommitted data are unreachable.
Conversely, once the root node address has been updated,
we know that all the data it references are also on disk.
In this way, commits are also durable.

[^fsync]: Calling ``fsync`` on a file descriptor
   asks the operating system and hard drive (or SSD)
   to write all buffered data immediately.
   Operating systems and drives don't usually write everything immediately
   in order to improve performance.

We're done!


### How NodeRefs Save Memory

To avoid keeping the entire tree structure in memory at the same time,
when a logical node is read in from disk
the disk address of its left and right children
(as well as its value)
are loaded into memory.
Accessing children and their values
requires one extra function call to ``NodeRef.get()``
to dereference ("really get") the data.

All we need to construct a ``NodeRef`` is an address:

    +---------+
    | NodeRef |
    | ------- |
    | addr=3  |
    | get()   |
    +---------+

Calling ``get()`` on it will return the concrete node,
along with that node's references as ``NodeRef``s:

    +---------+     +---------+     +---------+
    | NodeRef |     | Node    |     | NodeRef |
    | ------- |     | ------- | +-> | ------- |
    | addr=3  |     | key=A   | |   | addr=1  |
    | get() ------> | value=B | |   +---------+
    +---------+     | left  ----+
                    | right ----+   +---------+
                    +---------+ |   | NodeRef |
                                +-> | ------- |
                                    | addr=2  |
                                    +---------+

When changes to the tree are not committed,
they exist in memory
with references from the root down to the changed leaves.
The changes aren't saved to disk yet,
so the changed nodes contain concrete keys and values
and no disk addresses.
The process doing the writing can see uncommitted changes
and can make more changes before issuing a commit,
because ``NodeRef.get()`` will return the uncommitted value if it has one;
there is no difference between committed and uncommitted data
when accessed through the API.
All the updates will appear atomically to other readers
because changes aren't visible
until the new root node address is written to disk.
Concurrent updates are blocked by a lockfile on disk.
The lock is acquired on first update, and released after commit.


### Exercises for the Reader

DBDB allows many processes to read the same database at once without blocking;
the tradeoff is that readers can sometimes retrieve stale data.  What if we
needed to be able to read some data consistently?  A common use
case is reading a value and then updating it based on that value. How would you
write a method on `DBDB` to do this? What tradeoffs would you have to incur to
provide this functionality?

The algorithm used to update the data store
can be completely changed out
by replacing the string ``BinaryTree`` in ``interface.py``.
Data stores tend to use more complex types of search trees
such as B-trees, B+ trees, and others
to improve the performance.
While a balanced binary tree
(and this one isn't)
needs to do $O(log_2(n))$ random node reads to find a value,
a B+ tree needs many fewer, for example $O(log_{32}(n))$
because each node splits 32 ways instead of just 2.
This makes a huge different in practice,
since looking through 4 billion entries would go from
$log_2(2^{32}) = 32$ to $log_{32}(2^{32}) \approx 6.4$ lookups.
Each lookup is a random access,
which is incredibly expensive for hard disks with spinning platters.
SSDs help with the latency, but the savings in I/O still stand.

By default, values are stored by `ValueRef`
which expects bytes as values
(to be passed directly to `Storage`).
The binary tree nodes themselves
are just a subclass of `ValueRef`.
Storing richer data
via <a href="http://json.org">json</a> or <a href="http://msgpack.org">msgpack</a> is a matter of writing your own
and setting it as the `value_ref_class`.
`BinaryNodeRef` is an example of using
[pickle](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pickle.html)
to serialise data.

Database compaction is another interesting exercise.
Compacting can be done via an infix-of-median traversal of the tree writing
things out as you go.
It's probably best if the tree nodes all go together,
since they're what's traversed
to find any piece of data.
Packing as many intermediate nodes as possible
into a disk sector
should improve read performance,
at least right after compaction.
There are some subtleties here
(for example, memory usage)
if you try to implement this yourself.
And remember:
always benchmark performance enhancements before and after!
You'll often be surprised by the results.

### Patterns and Principles 

Test interfaces, not implementation.
As part of developing DBDB,
I wrote a number of tests
that described how I wanted to be able to use it.
The first tests ran against an in-memory version of the database,
then I extended DBDB to persist to disk,
and even later added the concept of NodeRefs.
Most of the tests didn't have to change,
which gave me confidence that things were still working.

Respect the Single Responsibility Principle.
Classes should have at most one reason to change.
That's not strictly the case with DBDB,
but there are multiple avenues of extension
with only localised changes required.
Refactoring as I added features was a pleasure!


### Summary

DBDB is a simple database that makes simple guarantees, and yet
things still became complicated in a hurry. The most important thing I did to
manage this complexity was to implement an ostensibly mutable object with an
immutable data structure. I encourage you to consider this technique the next
time you find yourself in the middle of a tricky problem that seems to have
more edge cases than you can keep track of.
