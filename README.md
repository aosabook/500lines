Mission
-------

Every architect studies family homes,
apartments,
schools,
and other common types of buildings during her training.
Equally,
every programmer ought to know how a compiler turns text into instructions,
how a spreadsheet updates cells,
and how a browser decides what to put where when it renders a page.
This book's goal is to give readers that broad-ranging overview,
and while doing so,
to help them understand how software designers think.

Contributions should not focus on the details of one algorithm
or on the features of a particular language.
Instead,
they should discuss the decisions and tradeoffs software architects make when crafting an application:

*   Why divide the application into these particular modules with these particular interfaces?
*   Why use inheritance here and composition there?
*   Why multi-thread this but not that?
*   When should the application allow for or rely on plugins,
    and how should they be configured and loaded?

Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

Writing for a book like this should be fun, so we're trying to keep process to
minimum. Here is our basic set of procedural guidelines:

1. When you start coding, try to submit one pull request early (e.g. somewhere
   between 50-100 lines), so that we can catch any early problems that we never
   thought about.

2. After that first commit, feel free to submit pull requests as often or as
   infrequently as you like.

3. When you are done your "first draft" of your code, do let us know in the
   commit message, or by emailing us directly (emails below). We'll assign a
   reviewer or two to your work at that time.
